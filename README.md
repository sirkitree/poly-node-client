Work in progress...

Currently this only provides access to public assets.

## Use
1. clone this repo to your project
1. rename config.example.js to config.js

## Plans
- [ ] parameter passing to the functions
- [ ] exporting of functions
- [ ] passport.js integration for API calls that require OAuth 2.0
- [ ] add to npm for easier inclusion in node projects
